- 👋 Hi, I’m Kevin Tracy, but you can call me @kevinjtracy here on GitHub. 
- 👀 I’m interested in Open Source Software, Web Development, Eliminating Social Media in favor of personal websites, and the proliferation of bidets.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Asesprite, Stream Avatars, 5-Point Perspective, and incorporate IndieWeb on my static web site.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web development tools where I can provide useful feedback.
- 📫 You can reach me on my website at https://www.ktracy.com/contact-kevin-tracy
